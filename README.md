### My First Real Project 💾

Yesterday, I was thinking I needed to practice code if I wanted to really learn it.
So I had this idea of making a small project using the things I've already learned, and since I recently studied about Lists, I thought a to-do list would be a good one to start with.
The process wasn't as smooth as I imagined - I had to do a lot of research and also get some help from AI to understand my mistakes - but, even though it took me the whole day, I've finished it! And I am very proud of it!

This is the first project I created from the very start, and I hope there will be many more from now on. ✨
